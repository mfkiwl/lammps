Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

This fix generates graphics objects from chunks of atoms defined by the
:doc:`compute chunk/atom <compute_chunk_atom>` command.  For chunks with
more than three atoms a triangulated convex hull is created, chunks with
a single atom are represented by a sphere, chunks with two atoms by a
cylinder connecting the two atoms, and chunks with three atoms by three
cylinders connecting the atoms and by two triangles on the sides.  The
resulting list of graphics objects is passed to :doc:`dump image
<dump_image>` for rendering via the *fix* keyword.

The positions used for the generation of the graphics are based on
unwrapped coordinates which are then mapped back into the simulation
cell based on the position of the first atom in the cluster.  When a
cluster will straddle a periodic boundary it should be drawn only on one
side of the boundary.

The *group-ID* selects the atoms included in the hull computation.  Only
atoms that belong to the specified group **and** are assigned to a chunk
are considered.

The *Nevery* keyword determines how often the list of the graphics
objects is recomputed.  It should match the dump frequency of the
corresponding :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` command.

The color of the graphics objects depends on the coloring scheme
selected in :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` command.  With the *type* or
*element* coloring scheme the color is based on atom type as described
below, with the *const* coloring scheme a uniform color is used instead.
This color can be set with the *fcolor* keyword of the :doc:`dump modify
<dump_image>` command.  When using atom type based colors, the objects
in the special cases of up to three atoms the graphics objects are
colored uniformly based on the smallest atom type of the cluster, while
for the convex hull the triangles are colored per vertex using the atom
type of the closest atom.

The optional *radius* keyword allows to override the radius value used
to determine the size of the represented graphics, either by setting the
radius of the objects directly or by inflating the convex hull.  If
available, the per-atom radius (e.g. for simulations using :doc:`atom
style sphere <atom_style>`) is used, otherwise half of the value of the
Lennard-Jones *sigma* parameter for the atom type. The fallback value is
0.1 length units.

The optional *shading* keyword selects how triangle normals are
determined for rendering convex hulls.  The *smooth* setting (the
default) computes averaged per-vertex normals so that adjacent triangles
appear curved and blend smoothly (except for sharp edges).  The *flat*
uses the face normal for all three corners of each triangle, giving the
hull a faceted appearance.

Dump image info
"""""""""""""""

Fix graphics/chunk is designed to be used with the *fix* keyword of
:doc:`dump image <dump_image>`.  The fix constructs a list of graphics
objects based the size and geometry of the chunks in the fix group and
passes the information to the image renderer.

The *fflag1* setting of *dump image fix* determines whether the hull is
rendered as connected rounded triangles (1) or as a wireframe mesh of
cylinders (2).  If using a wireframe mesh, the *fflag2* setting
determines the diameter of the cylinders.

For small clusters with 3 atoms or less both flags are ignored.
