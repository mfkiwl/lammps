Visualize LAMMPS snapshots
==========================

Snapshots from LAMMPS simulations can be viewed, visualized, and
analyzed in a variety of ways.

LAMMPS snapshots are created by the :doc:`dump <dump>` command, which
can create files in several formats. The native LAMMPS dump format is a
text file (see :lammps:`dump atom` or :lammps:`dump custom`) which can
be visualized by `several visualization tools
<https://www.lammps.org/viz.html>`_ for MD simulation trajectories.
`OVITO <https://www.ovito.org>`_ and `VMD
<https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ seem to be the most popular
choices among them.

The :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` and :doc:`dump movie <dump_image>`
styles can output internally rendered images or convert them to a movie
during the MD run.  It is also possible to create visualizations from
LAMMPS inputs or restart file with `LAMMPS-GUI
<https://lammps-gui.lammps.org/>`_, which uses the :doc:`dump image
<dump_image>` command internally.  If the LAMMPS input already contains
a :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` command, the resulting images will be
noted by LAMMPS-GUI and can be viewed and animated directly in the
``Slide Show`` dialog. The images can be transformed (i.e. scaled,
mirrored, or rotated) and exported into a video, too.  The ``Image
Viewer`` dialog in LAMMPS-GUI can be used to visualize the *current*
system, adjust a variety of visualization settings interactively from
the GUI, and then one can export the corresponding LAMMPS commands to
the clipboard to be inserted into an input file.

Programs included with LAMMPS as auxiliary tools can convert
between LAMMPS format files and other formats.  See the :doc:`Tools
<Tools>` page for details.  These are rarely needed these days.

Advanced graphics features in the *dump image* command
======================================================

.. versionadded:: TBD

The following paragraphs discuss some of the more advanced features in
the :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` command in LAMMPS with the help of
some simple input file examples.  For exact details of keywords and
arguments, please refer to the detailed documentation of the command.

Please note that many of these features were added or significantly
updated after LAMMPS version 10 Sep 2025 and well into the 2026
stable version development cycle.  If you are using an older version
of LAMMPS, these examples may cause errors or may look differently.

Image quality and resolution
----------------------------

The two keywords *fsaa* and *ssao* can be used to improve the image
quality at the expense of additional computational cost to render the
images. The images below show from left to right the same render with
the default settings, with *fsaa* enabled, with *ssao* enabled, and with
both features enabled.

.. |imagequality1| image:: JPG/image.default.png
   :width: 24%
.. |imagequality2| image:: JPG/image.fsaa.png
   :width: 24%
.. |imagequality3| image:: JPG/image.ssao.png
   :width: 24%
.. |imagequality4| image:: JPG/image.both.png
   :width: 24%

|imagequality1|  |imagequality2|  |imagequality3|  |imagequality4|

The computational cost to create the images with :doc:`dump image
<dump_image>` depends on the image size, the number of objects to be
rendered (this number can grow quickly when using fine triangle meshes),
and the choice of the *fsaa* and *ssao* settings.  For high resolution
images, a correspondingly large image size has to be chosen.  Same as it
is done implicitly when enabling FSAA, one can improve image quality by
rendering images at a large size and then processing and scaling them to
the desired size in a image processing software.  Since the simulation
has to wait for dump image to complete its image rendering, creating
high resolution and high quality images can slow down as simulation
significantly.  On the other hand, the image rasterizer in LAMMPS is
fairly simple and thus fast compared to more advanced image generation
tools like ray tracers.  At the moment there is no GPU acceleration or
multi-threading parallelization available, except for the
multi-threading support for SSAO processing.

--------------------

Color selection and color management
------------------------------------



--------------------

Transparency
------------

It is now possible to create approximately transparent graphics objects
using an `ordered dithering algorithm
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering>`_ which results in a
so-called *screen-door transparency* effect.  In essence, for a
transparent object only a part of the pixels are drawn and thus exposing
any object behind the transparent object where drawing the pixels is
skipped.  LAMMPS employs a 16x16 Bayer matrix pattern that leads to
rather regular patterns.  A benefit of this approach is that it does not
add extra cost to the rendering and for a 25%, 50%, and 75% transparency
setting, there are no visible pixel patterns when also FSAA is enabled.
In this case each pixel is the average of a 2x2 block of pixels in an
image of double the width and height, and thus the transparent object
will contribute 3, 2, or 1 pixels to the 2x2 block which is averaged.

Transparency is typically - like the color of objects - associated with
an atom type and can be modified through the :doc:`dump_modify atrans
<dump_image>` command and specified as an opacity ratio, i.e. a number
between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).  Other choices are
available and described in the documentation page.

Creating and viewing animated GIFs and movie files
--------------------------------------------------

A series of JPEG, PNG, or PPM images can be converted into a movie file
and then played as a movie using commonly available tools.  Using dump
style *movie* automates this step *and* avoids the intermediate step of
writing (many) image snapshot file.  But LAMMPS has to be compiled with
``-DLAMMPS_FFMPEG`` and a compatible FFmpeg executable has to be
installed.  When using `LAMMPS-GUI <https://lammps-gui.lammps.org/>`_ to
run LAMMPS, you can run the simulation and LAMMPS-GUI will automatically
show the created images in its ``Slideshow Viewer`` dialog.  From there
you can animate or single step through them and also export them to a
movie file via FFMpeg.

To manually convert JPEG, PNG or PPM files into an animated GIF or
MPEG or other movie file you can use:

#. Use the ImageMagick ``convert`` program (called ``magick`` in recent versions).

   .. code-block:: bash

      convert *.jpg foo.gif
      convert -loop 1 *.ppm foo.mpg

   Animated GIF files from ImageMagick are not optimized. You can use
   a program like gifsicle to optimize and thus massively shrink them.
   MPEG files created by ImageMagick are in MPEG-1 format with a rather
   inefficient compression and low quality compared to more modern
   compression styles like MPEG-4, H.264, VP8, VP9, H.265 and so on.

#. Use QuickTime.

   Select "Open Image Sequence" under the File menu Load the images into
   QuickTime to animate them Select "Export" under the File menu Save the
   movie as a QuickTime movie (\*.mov) or in another format.  QuickTime
   can generate very high quality and efficiently compressed movie
   files. Some of the supported formats require to buy a license and some
   are not readable on all platforms until specific runtime libraries are
   installed.

#. Use FFmpeg

   `FFMpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_ is a command-line tool that is
   available on many platforms and allows extremely flexible encoding
   and decoding of movies.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat snap.*.jpg | ffmpeg -y -f image2pipe -c:v mjpeg -i - -b:v 2000k movie.m4v
      cat snap.*.ppm | ffmpeg -y -f image2pipe -c:v ppm -i - -b:v 2400k movie.mp4

   Front ends for FFmpeg exist for multiple platforms. For more
   information see the `FFmpeg homepage <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_

----------

Play the movie:

#. Use your web browser to view an animated GIF or MP4 movie format movie.

   Select "Open File" under the File menu
   Load the animated GIF or MP4 movie file

#. Use the freely available `VideoLAN media player (vlc)
   <https://videolan.org>`_ or `FFMpeg player tool (ffplay)
   <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_ to view a movie.

   Both are available for multiple operating systems and support a large
   variety of file formats and decoders.  There are plenty more media
   player packages available on the different operating systems.

   .. code-block:: bash

      vlc foo.mpg
      ffplay bar.avi

#. Use the `Pizza.py <https://lammps.github.io/pizza/>`_
   `animate tool <https://lammps.github.io/pizza/doc/animate.html>`_,
   which works directly on a series of image files.

   .. code-block:: python

      a = animate("foo*.jpg")

#. QuickTime and other Windows- or macOS-based media players can
   obviously play movie files directly. Similarly for corresponding tools
   bundled with Linux desktop environments.  However, due to licensing
   issues with some file formats, the formats may require installing
   additional libraries, purchasing a license, or may not be
   supported.

Visualizing systems using potentials with implicit bonds
--------------------------------------------------------

There are several pair styles available in LAMMPS where the bond
information is not taken from from the bond topology in a data file but
the potentials first determine a "bond-order" parameter for pairs of
atoms and - depending on the value of that parameter - apply forces for
bonded interactions.  This applies to :doc:`ReaxFF <pair_reaxff>`,
:doc:`REBO and AIREBO <pair_airebo>`, :doc:`BOP <pair_bop>`, and several
others pair styles.  These implicit bonds will not be shown by
:doc:`dump image <dump_image>` since its mechanism for displaying bonds
relies on explicit bonds being present in the bond topology.

One can hide the fact that there are no bonds by setting the atom radii
to the covalent radii of the corresponding elements (see leftmost
example image below).  This will result in a representation often
labeled as "VDW" in popular visualization tools.  Otherwise, there are
currently three approaches to make those bonds visible.

#. Access the (internal) bond order information from the pair style
   through a custom fix and then use the *fix* keyword of the :doc:`dump
   image <dump_image>` command to use the graphics objects information
   provided by the fix to visualize the bonds (see below for more
   information).  That includes bonds that are broken and formed.  This
   is the most accurate option since it uses the data that is used by
   the computation of the model.  This is currently only available for
   ReaxFF by using :doc:`fix reaxff/bonds <fix_reaxff_bonds>`.

   #. Use the *autobonds* keyword of :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` to
   approximate the bonds based on a simple distance heuristic.  This is
   similar to the *Dynamic Bonds* representation in `VMD
   <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_.  How accurate this option
   will be depends on the complexity of the system and how many
   different bond lengths there are.  For the simple water system shown
   below, there are no significant differences, since there is only one
   type of bond (between oxygen and hydrogen).  The *autobond* keyword
   uses on top of the distance cutoff between atoms, the heuristic that
   no bonds will be drawn between two hydrogen atoms and thus bogus
   bonds are avoided when using a larger bond cutoff (e.g. suitable for
   carbon-carbon bonds) which is larger than the typical
   hydrogen-hydrogen distance for hydrogen atoms bound to the same atom
   (e.g. in water, methane or hydrocarbon chains).

#. Use use a combination of :doc:`fix bond/break <fix_bond_break>`
   and :doc:`fix bond/create/angle <fix_bond_create>` with :doc:`bond
   style zero <bond_zero>` to dynamically create and remove bonds that
   do not add any forces.  This also requires to tell the neighbor list
   code to not treat any pairs of atoms as special neighbors (otherwise
   the corresponding pairs of atoms could be excluded from the neighbor
   list and thus the forces computed by the pair style incorrect)
   through using the :doc:`special_bonds <special_bonds>` command.
   Unlike the two other options which were recently added when this
   document when was written, this method also works with older versions
   of LAMMPS.  Here is an example of the necessary commands for a carbon
   nanotube (that is modeled with AIREBO):

   .. code-block:: LAMMPS

      bond_style zero
      bond_coeff 1 1.4
      special_bonds lj/coul 1.0 1.0 1.0
      fix break all bond/break 1000 1 2.5
      fix form all bond/create/angle 1000 1 1 2.0 1 aconstrain 90.0 180

   This "graphics hack" was originally posted as part of the LAMMPS
   tutorial at
   https://lammpstutorials.github.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorial2/breaking-a-carbon-nanotube.html

.. Visualizing tri or line particles
.. ---------------------------------
..
.. -------------

Visualizing body particles
--------------------------

Body particles are objects formed from either a collection of spherical
particles, polygons (in 2d), or polyhedra (in 3d) formed from triangular
or quadrilateral surfaces.  The regular :doc:`dump <dump>` command can
only output the center of those bodies (and their orientation), which
complicates the visualization with external tools.  In addition, the
position of the constituent particles of *nparticles* bodies or the
positions of the vertices of *rounded/polygon* or *rounded/polyhedron*
bodies, which can be computed with :doc:`compute body/local
<compute_body_local>` and output with :doc:`dump local <dump>`.

As an alternative, the bodies can be visualized directly with :doc:`dump
image <dump_image>` using the *body* keyword.  Without the *body*
keyword the body particles would be visualized like atoms as single
spheres.  The color and transparency settings can be changed by settings
those properties for the corresponding atom types.  It is also possible
to represent the bodies as either wireframes (*bflag1* value 2), planar
faces (*bflag1* value 1), or both (*bflag1* value 3).

-------------

Visualizing ellipsoid particles
-------------------------------

Ellipsoidal particles are a generalization of spheres that may have
three different radii to define the shape.  They can be modeled using
pair styles :doc:`gayberne <pair_gayberne>` or :doc:`resquared
<pair_resquared>`.  The regular :doc:`dump custom <dump>` command can
output the center of those bodies, the shape parameters and the
orientation as quaternions.  If one follows the required conventions and
follows the documented steps, those trajectory dump files can be
`imported and visualized in OVITO
<https://www.ovito.org/manual/advanced_topics/aspherical_particles.html>`_

As an alternative, the ellipsoid particles can be visualized directly
with :doc:`dump image <dump_image>` using the *ellipsoid* keyword.  The
color and transparency settings can be changed by settings those
properties for the corresponding atom types.  It is also possible to
represent the ellipsoids via generating a triangle mesh and visualizing
it as either wireframes (*eflag* value 2), planar faces (*eflag* value
1), or both (*eflag* value 3), same as demonstrated for body particles
above.  The use of a triangle mesh is currently required since the
rasterizer built into LAMMPS does not offer a suitable graphics
primitive for ellipsoids.  The mesh is constructed by iteratively
refining a triangle mesh representing an octahedron where each triangle
is replaced by four triangles.  For a smooth representation a refinement
level of 5 or 6 is required, which will cause a significant slowdown of
the rendering of the image.  Also, some artifacts can happen due to
rounding which can be somewhat minimized using FSAA (which causes
further slowdown of the rendering).

These images were created by adding the following :doc:`dump image and dump_modify <dump_image>`
commands to the ``in.ellipse.resquared`` input example:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

Visualizing regions
-------------------

Since there are several commands that operate on atoms within a specific
:doc:`region <region>` , it can be helpful to visualize the extent of
those regions, either for debugging the command settings or for
visualizing the production simulation.  This is even more useful when
regions are (dynamically) translated or rotated or both with the
*rotate* or *move* keyword of the *region* command.  The :doc:`dump
image region <dump_image>` keyword can be used to enable such
visualizations.  There are currently four different draw styles
available:

* *filled*: a mesh of triangles is constructed for the surface of the
  region and then drawn in the selected color.  This draw style accounts
  for the *open* keyword of the :doc:`region <region>` command and only
  draws the faces of a region that are closed.
* *transparent*: this is the same visualization as draw style *filled*,
  but in addition one can set the transparency of that visualization
  through an opacity parameter in the range of 0.0 (invisible) to 1.0
  (fully opaque).
* *frame*: uses the same mesh of triangles as the two styles above
  above, but renders the region's surface as a wireframe mesh with a
  given cylinder diameter.
* *points*: generates a cloud of random points inside the simulation box
  and then only draws a point as a sphere with the given color and
  radius if it is located inside the region.  This is useful to check
  the impact of the *side in/out* setting of a region, and complementary
  to the other three draw styles, which only show the region surfaces.
  For visualization purposes any open faces of a region are ignored,
  since a region with an open face matches *all* particles.

It can sometimes be convenient to draw the same region with multiple
draw styles as can be seen from the example visualization images below.

Notes on the visualization of individual region styles:

* *plane*: since in theory planes extend infinitely, some form of
  boundary has to be established for the visualization.  Therefore a
  mesh of triangles is constructed and transformed according to the
  region settings and then only those triangles are drawn, where at
  least one corner is inside the simulation box.  For draw style
  *points* the *side in/out* setting determines on which side of the
  plane the points are drawn.
* *cone* and *cylinder*: use triangle meshes for draw styles *filled*
  and *transparent* since there are no equivalent primitives (the
  cylinder primitive only draws half of the cylinder, since it is
  optimized for being capped).  For draw style *frame*, only the rim
  of the top or bottom is drawn and the side is represented by lines
  from the top to the bottom.
* *box* and *prism*: for draw style *frame* only the edges of the region
  are shown; for draw styles *filled* and *transparent*, the faces are
  drawn instead, but only if they are not set as "open" in the
  :doc:`region <region>` command.

Visualizing graphics provided by fix commands
---------------------------------------------

LAMMPS can display additional graphics objects in the :doc:`dump image
<dump_image>` output that are added by fix styles.  These fall in two
categories: fixes that were written with the specific purpose of adding
graphics to the visualization and fixes that make objects or data
visible that they maintain internally.  Examples for the latter case are
visualizing the indenter object from :doc:`fix indent <fix_indent>` or
the wall position from one of the wall fixes.  The details of what kind
of graphics is added and how it can be configured is described in a
section titled **Dump image info** in the documentation of the
individual fix commands.

Below is a table with links to the documentation of supported fix
styles:

.. table_from_list::
   :columns: 4

   * :doc:`fix graphics <fix_graphics>`
   * :doc:`fix graphics/arrows <fix_graphics_arrows>`
   * :doc:`fix indent <fix_indent>`
   * :doc:`fix reaxff/bonds <fix_reaxff_bonds>`
   * :doc:`fix smd/wall_surface <fix_smd_wall_surface>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/lj93 <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/lj126 <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/lj1043 <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/colloid <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/gran <fix_wall_gran>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/harmonic <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/harmonic/outside <fix_wall>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/lepton <fix_wall>`

   * :doc:`fix wall/reflect <fix_wall_reflect>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/reflect/stochastic <fix_wall_reflect_stochastic>`
   * :doc:`fix wall/table <fix_wall>`

There is no support for :doc:`fix wall/region <fix_wall_region>` and
:doc:`fix wall/gran/region <fix_wall_gran_region>`, since regions can be
visualized with the *region* keyword of :doc:`dump image <dump_image>`
already (see discussion above).

Below are discussions about some aspects of specific fix commands and some input examples.

Fix graphics
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix :doc:`graphics <fix_graphics>` adds some graphics primitives and
more complex objects like a progress bar to the visualization where
properties of the object(s) are controlled by :doc:`equal-style or
compatible variables <variable>`.

Fix graphics/arrows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix :doc:`graphics/arrows <fix_graphics_arrows>` adds per-atom or
per-chunk arrows to the visualization.  The arrows represent some
per-atom property or per-chunk 3-vector property.  For atoms, there are
the pre-defined properties *force*, *velocity*, and *dipole* (requires
atom style *dipole*).  Everything else would have to be computed in
:doc:`atom-style or compatible variables <variable>` and use the
*variable* keyword.  For per-chunk properties, one needs to use the
*chunk* keyword and provide the IDs of three computes: a
:doc:`chunk/atom compute <compute_chunk_atom>` and two per-chunk
computes where the first defines the position of the (middle of the)
arrow and the second the direction and length of the arrow.  Popular
choices would create per-molecule or per-bin chunks.  Below is an
example input section that computes and displays both, the total dipole
moment (using :doc:`fix graphics <fix_graphics>` and the per-molecule
dipole moment as arrows in addition to the per-atom velocities:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute molchunk all chunk/atom molecule
   compute cpos all com/chunk molchunk wrap yes
   compute cdip all dipole/chunk molchunk
   fix vel all graphics/arrows 10 velocity 50.0 0.066 autoscale 0.25
   fix vec all graphics/arrows 10 chunk molchunk cpos cdip 3 0.1

   compute dip all dipole
   variable scale equal 0.75
   variable dip1x equal -v_scale*c_dip[1]
   variable dip1y equal -v_scale*c_dip[2]
   variable dip1z equal -v_scale*c_dip[3]
   variable dip2x equal v_scale*c_dip[1]
   variable dip2y equal v_scale*c_dip[2]

Fix reaxff/bonds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix :doc:`reaxff/bonds <fix_reaxff_bonds>` of the :ref:`REAXFF package
<pkg-reaxff>` provides access to the list of bonds as they are
dynamically computed by the :doc:`ReaxFF pair style <pair_reaxff>`.  As
discussed above, this can be used to visualize bonds for a system where
there is no explicit bond topology defined.

Fix smd/wall_surface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix :doc:`smd/wall_surface <fix_smd_wall_surface>` of the :ref:`MACHDYN
package <pkg-machdyn>` creates a custom wall from a mesh of triangles
that is read from an STL format file.
