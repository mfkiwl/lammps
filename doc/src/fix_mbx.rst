Description
"""""""""""

The MBX (Many-Body eXpansion) software is a C++ library that provides access
to many-body energy (MB-nrg) potential energy functions, such as the MB-pol
water model. Developed over the past decade, these potential energy functions
integrate physics-based and machine-learned many-body terms
trained on electronic structure data calculated at the "gold
standard" coupled-cluster level of theory. :ref:`(Gupta) <Gupta>`


This fix instructs LAMMPS to call the `MBX library <_mbxwebsite>`_
in order to simulate MB-nrg models such as MB-pol. This fix must be
used in conjunction with the :doc:`pair mbx <pair_mbx>` command.

The MBX library code development is available at
`https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX <https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX>`_.
A detailed discussion of the code can be found in the manuscript :ref:`(Riera) <Riera>`.


See ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for complete examples of how to use
this fix command.

For hybrid simulations involving MB-nrg and non-MB-nrg molecules in the
same simulation, one can use :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`
to combine the MB-nrg molecules with other pair styles, such as
:doc:`lj/cut <pair_lj>`. Do note that all electrostatics must be computed within MBX, so the
:doc:`coul/exclude <pair_coul>` pair_style should usually be applied on the non-MB-nrg molecules.
See ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for a complete hybrid example.


The *num_mon_types* argument specifies the number of different MB-nrg monomer types in the system.

The *monomer_specification* argument provides the details for each monomer type.
This information is used by MBX to map the LAMMPS atom IDs to the corresponding MBX monomer types.
For each monomer type, the following information must be provided:

* monomer_name = name of the monomer type
  (e.g. h2o for water, ch4 for methane)
* monomer_lower_atom_index = lower atom index of the monomer
  (e.g. 1 for O in water)
* monomer_upper_atom_index = upper atom index of the monomer
  (e.g. 2 for H in water)
* monomer_num_atoms = number of atoms in the monomer
  (e.g. 3 for water, 5 for methane)
* atom_ids = list of LAMMPS atom IDs in the monomer, in the
  order they appear in the MB-nrg potential.
  (e.g. 1 2 2 for water, as it corresponds to O H H)


The *json* argument specifies the name of the MBX JSON configuration file to use, such as `mbx.json`.
If this file is not provided, the fix will attempt to use a default configuration.

The *print/dipoles* argument enables the printing of dipole moments as part of the fix variable output.
This is useful for performing vibrational spectroscopy calculations such as IR, Raman, and Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG).

The *print/settings* argument will print the MBX settings to the LAMMPS logfile at the start of the simulation.
This is used for debugging and ensuring that the correct settings are being applied.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MBX package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info. This fix also relies on the
presence of :doc:`pair mbx <pair_mbx>` command.

There can only be one fix mbx command active at a time.

Due to the usage of Partridge and Schwenke charges for MB-pol,
all electrostatic interactions are calculated internally in MBX.
Therefore one should never calculate coulombic interactions in
LAMMPS such as using `coul/cut` or `coul/long` when also using MBX.
