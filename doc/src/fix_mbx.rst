Description
"""""""""""

This fix instructs LAMMPS to call the `MBX library <_mbxwebsite>`_
in order to simulate MB-nrg models such as MB-pol. This fix must be
used in conjunction with the :doc:`pair mbx <pair_mbx>` command.

The MBX library code development is available at
`https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX <https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX>`_.
A detailed discussion of the code can be found in the manuscript :ref:`(Riera) <Riera>`.

If you have questions not answered by this documentation, please reach
out to us at `https://groups.google.com/g/mbx-users <https://groups.google.com/g/mbx-users>`_


See ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for complete examples of how to use
this fix command.

For hybrid simulations involving MB-nrg and non-MB-nrg molecules in the
same simulation, one can use :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`
to combine the MB-nrg molecules with other pair styles, such as
:doc:`lj/cut <pair_lj>`. Do note that all electrostatics must be computed within MBX, so the
:doc:`coul/exclude <pair_coul>` pair_style must be applied on the non-MB-nrg molecules.
See  ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for a complete hybrid example.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MBX package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info. This fix also relies on the
presence of :doc:`pair mbx <pair_mbx>` command.

There can only be one fix mbx command active at a time.

Due to the usage of Partridge and Schwenke charges for MB-pol,
all electrostatic interactions are calculated internally in MBX.
Therefore one should never calculate coulombic interactions in
LAMMPS such as using `coul/cut` or `coul/long`.
