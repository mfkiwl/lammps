======================

Syntax
""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

    pair_style mbx cutoff

* cutoff = real-space cutoff for MBX. 9.0 Angstroms is usually a safe value.

Description
"""""""""""

The MBX (Many-Body eXpansion) software is a C++ library that provides access
to many-body energy (MB-nrg) potential energy functions, such as the MB-pol
water model. Developed over the past decade, these potential energy functions
integrate physics-based and machine-learned many-body terms
trained on electronic structure data calculated at the “gold
standard” coupled-cluster level of theory. :ref:`(Gupta) <Gupta>`

This pair_style instructs LAMMPS to call the `MBX library <_mbxwebsite>`_
in order to simulate MB-nrg models such as MB-pol. This pair_style must be
used in conjunction with the :doc:`fix mbx <fix_mbx>` command.


The MBX library code development is available at
`https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX <https://github.com/paesanilab/MBX>`_.
A detailed discussion of the code can be found in the manuscript :ref:`(Riera) <Riera>`.


See ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for complete examples of how to use
this fix command.

For hybrid simulations involving MB-nrg and non-MB-nrg molecules in the
same simulation, one can use :doc:`pair_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`
to combine the MB-nrg molecules with other pair styles, such as
:doc:`lj/cut <pair_lj>`. Do note that all electrostatics must be computed within MBX, so the
:doc:`coul/exclude <pair_coul>` pair_style should usually be applied on the non-MB-nrg molecules.
See ``examples/PACKAGES/mbx`` for a complete hybrid example.


Since MBX is a many-body method, it is internally parameterized and does not require explicit
specification of all pairwise interactions. Therefore, `pair_coeff` should always just be set
to ``pair_coeff * *`` when using MBX. Failure to properly set the pair_coeff results in the
common error ``Incorrect args for pair coefficients``.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This pair_style is part of the MBX package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info. This pair_style also relies on the
presence of :doc:`fix mbx <fix_mbx>` command.

Due to the usage of Partridge and Schwenke charges for MB-pol,
all electrostatic interactions are calculated internally in MBX.
Therefore one should never calculate coulombic interactions in
LAMMPS such as using `coul/cut` or `coul/long` when also using MBX.
