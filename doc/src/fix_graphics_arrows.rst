Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

This fix allows to add arrows to images rendered with :doc:`dump image
<dump_image>` using the *fix* keyword to represent vector properties
with arrows atoms from all atoms in the fix group.

The *group-ID* sets the group ID of the atoms selected to have the selected
property represented.  This may be a dynamic group.

The *Nevery* keyword determines how often the arrows graphics data is
updated.  This should be the same value as the corresponding *N*
parameter of the :doc:`dump <dump>` image command.  LAMMPS will stop
with an error message if the settings for this fix and the dump command
are not compatible.

There are five keywords available that determine what is shown: *dipole*
will show the per-atom dipole vector, *force* the per-atom force,
*velocity* the per-atom velocity, *variable* a custom vector constructed
from three constants or atom- or equal-style variables. With the *chunk*
keyword per-chunk vectors will be shown.

The *xval*\ , *yval*\ , and *zval*\ , arguments to the *variable* mode
define a custom vector that can be composed of numbers or :doc:`atom- or
equal-style variables <variable>`.  If any of these values is a
variable, it should be specified as *v_name*\ , where "name" is the
variable name.  In this case, the variable will be evaluated each
timestep, and its value used to define the arrow for each atom.  Since
variables can reference :doc:`computes <compute>`, :doc:`fixes <fix>`,
:doc:`custom per-atom properties <fix_property_atom>`, and other
variables, this can be used to construct arrows for almost any per-atom
property available in LAMMPS.

The *scale* quantity determines the length of the arrows.  It should be
chosen so that when multiplied with the per-atom vector quantity the result
is of the same order of magnitude as atom positions, so that the vectors
can be seen well.

The *radius* quantity determines the width of the arrows.

Dump image info
"""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

Fix graphics/arrows is designed to be used with the *fix* keyword of
:doc:`dump image <dump_image>`.  The fix will add spheres based on the
atoms in the fix group across all arrows to *dump image* so that they
are included in the rendered image.

The color of the arrows is by default that of the atoms when using color
styles "type" or "element".  With color style "const" the default value
of "white" can be changed using :doc:`dump_modify fcolor <dump_image>`.
Similarly, the transparency follows the atom type or can be changed for
color style "const" with *dump\_modify ftrans*\ .


The *fflag1* and *fflag2* settings of *dump image fix* are currently ignored.
